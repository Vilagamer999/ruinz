For every upvote this post gets I will ban one "For every upvote this post gets" poster
Hey folks, just got a few dozen messages complaining about the influx of upvote begging posts on my way to secure my second multi-billion deal this week for a global conglomerate. Now I don't like interruptions on my private jets when flying to make said deals in the far reaches of the globe but this matter is clearly very important and I would like to address it head on.

Posts that fall under "For every upvote I will ____" and other upvote begging posts will be removed as they are not copypasta and redditors who post them will be temporarily banned going forward.

That kind of content is not copypasta or original and belongs more on subreddits like r/circlejerk or r/braveryjerk. Upvote begging posts have ruined many a subreddits that you show your friends and then nervously laugh while reassuring them that the sub was better way back in the day as they look on in disgust.

Here are some examples of low quality posts that were made today. (Each word is a clickable link!) And the a sample of the complaints not to mention over 58 reports.

During my numerous business dealings with leaders of major countries I like to read the newest meemee pasta on my $2,500 phone and it's a real owchie when there are none just so Kevin can get his latest karma hit. Yeah, that Kevin who sprinkles emojis on stale copypasta and serves it to the wide-eyed innocent r/copypasta subscribers who don't know any better. The same subscribers that later become jaded, spam subs with low-effort karmagrabs themselves and lie to their dentist claiming that they "floss all the time, I swear" when they are actually referring to the dance craze from the popular real time strategy game Forteen-Nights™.

tl;dr post more copypasta, less garbage

I AM THE EGG MAN
I have noticed that, although this subreddit has 481k readers, I am not receiving 481k upvotes on my posts.
I have noticed that, although this subreddit has 481k readers, I am not receiving 481k upvotes on my posts. I'm not sure if this is being done intentionally or if these "friends" are forgetting to click 'upvote'. Either way, I've had enough. I have compiled a spreadsheet of individuals who have "forgotten" to upvote my most recent posts. After 2 consecutive strikes, your name is automatically highlighted (shown in red) and I am immediately notified. 3 consecutive strikes and you can expect an in-person "consultation". Think about your actions.

edit: whoever spend gold on this post probably has sever autism

Some girl in our group chat said “meow” and my friend wrote this entire response by hand
Wowwwww, you meow like a cat! That means you are one, right? Shut the fuck up. If you really want to be put on a leash and treated like a domestic animal then that’s called a fetish, not “quirky” or “cute”. What part of you seriously thinks that any part of acting like a feline establishes a reputation of appreciation? Is it your lack of any defining aspect of personality that urges you to resort to shitty representations of cats to create an illusion of meaning in your worthless life? Wearing “cat ears” in the shape of headbands further notes the complete absence of human attribution to your false sense of personality, such as intelligence or charisma in any form or shape. Where do you think this mindset’s gonna lead you? You think you’re funny, random, quirky even? What makes you think that acting like a fucking cat will make a goddamn hyena laugh? I, personally, feel extremely sympathetic towards you as your only escape from the worthless thing you call your existence is to pretend to be an animal. But it’s not a worthy choice to assert this horrifying fact as a dominant trait, mainly because personality traits require an initial personality to lay their foundation on. You’re not worthy of anybody’s time, so go fuck off, “cat-girl”.

AITA for not showing up to my own funeral?
So I (74M) was recently hit by a car (2014 Honda) and died. My wife (5F) organized me a funeral (cost $2747) without asking me (74M) at all. I (74M) was unable to make it because I (74M) was dead (17 days). At the funeral I heard my dad (15M) and other family members talking about how they wish I could be there and now I feel bad for not showing up. AITA?

Edit: u/RadGlitch (6 years old) and an anonymous Reddit user are NTA for giving me gold (500 Reddit coins) and platinum (1800 Reddit coins)

Logan Paul apology but I replace the word “apologize” with “cum”
Logan Paul Apology but I replace "apologize" with "cum"

I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement and I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm simply here to cum. So what we came across that day on the woods was obviously unplanned and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down, and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't, and for that from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to cum to the internet, I want to cum to anyone who's seen the video, I want to cum to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But, most importantly, I want to cum to the victim and his family. For, my fans, who are defending my actions, please don't, they do not deserve to be defended. The goal of my content is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all inclusive and in the world I live in I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said, I made a huge mistake, I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to cum. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed in myself, and I promise to be better. I will be better, thank you.

AITA for literally being a perfect person?
English is my fourth language and I'm writing this on my phone with a throwaway account using only my toes while reading Kierkegaard so please forgive me for any grammar mistakes. :)

So, a little backstory. I'm a 24-year-old female, 5'10, white (thank God), skinny with DD breasts and an ass that barely fits in skinny jeans. People often say that I'm the most stunningly gorgeous person they've ever met and I should consider modeling but I dunno lol. I'm childfree, an atheist, a meat lover, and strictly heterosexual.

Anyway, both my parents died in a Muslim terrorist attack when I was 12 along with all my aunts, uncles, and grandparents so I took it upon myself to raise all twenty of my siblings and cousins singlehandedly, working four full-time jobs while going to school, leading eight clubs, captaining the varsity volleyball, water polo, and basketball teams, and volunteering at a hospital all while maintaining a healthy social life. I'm currently working on my fifth Ph.D. in between running my successful non-profit to end global poverty, writing my eleventh novel, starring in the final Tarantino film, streaming Minecraft, protesting in Hong Kong, and phone banking for Bernie Sanders.

So I was at the hardware store picking out a chandelier to put in the house I'm building for the homeless when this fat, smelly, repulsive, gay, transgender "woman" walks up to me and shrieks, "you're oppressing me by being thin! Eat a fucking vegan burger you skinny slut!" I hit her with the "okay boomer," and she responded, "that's literally as offensive as calling me a n*gger!" Then she threw her slimy crotch goblin at me and screamed, "get her, Jayden! Infect her with your polio that you got because I refuse to vaccinate you!" I didn't wanna be a Karen and call the manager over to settle this so I took it upon myself to personally vaccinate her child right on the spot and saved his life. The "woman" then tried to convert me to Christianity so I kicked her in the balls and dragged her out of the store. Everyone clapped, the manager gave me $1,000 (which I donated to TeamTrees), and Obama reached out to thank me for my bravery.

So reddit. Fellow redditors. People of reddit. Denizens of reddit.com. Wise sages of the internet. Tell me the truth. Am I the asshole?

Edit: Wow, this got a lot more attention than I thought it would! Since a lot of people are asking, yes, I am a Navy SEAL and no, I have never pooped in my entire life. I was a quadriplegic after this incident but I overcame the paralysis very quickly because I'm not a little bitch. Also, because it seems to be relevant, here are the details of my sex life: I get plowed three to four times a day by my perfect lover, I'm into every kink imaginable, I have no gag reflex, and my tubes are tied so no worries there. Apparently sex with me cures all diseases and causes a bigger dopamine hit than heroin, but I dunno.

I finally did it. Figured out how large Thanos’s mighty erect penis is.
I know what you’re thinking: How could I have done this? Well, allow me to explain. I started out with an image. The picture was of Thanos and Iron Man standing next to each other. This image was exactly what I needed. It came directly from Marvel, so we know for certain that the proportions are correct. Now that we have the two characters, how does one go about actually determining Thano’s length? That’s easy. We only need the length of Robert Downey Jr.’s penis. Luckily, we have a vague idea of just how large that is. Back in 2014, Robert Downey Jr. was quoted saying something along the lines of: “I have a massive dick, and feminism is a joke”. From this statement, we can determine one major thing: Robert Downey Jr. slays women with his massive peen.

But just how big is “massive?” to answer that, we need to do some research. Taking to the internet, I used pixel measurements, and calculated the length of many many penises, that belonged to various different porn stars. I averaged the results, and came up with about 3.8 inches flaccid, on average. If Robert Downey Jr. truly has a massive penis, than his must be slightly larger than this. Therefore, I elected to round up to 4 inches.

Next up, we need to do some more pixel measurements. Tony stark is 6’1” so in this image, we used that number to calculate how many pixels per inch this picture had. We came up with the number of 7 pixels per inch. Using this number, we were able to discover that thanos was 98 inches tall, or 8’2”. The same was done for horizontal width. After some quick calculations, we determined that Thanos was approximately 1.36 times larger than Robert Downey Jr. With this proportion in hand, we can now do the unthinkable. If we take Robert Downey Jr.’s length of 4” and multiply it by 1.35, we get 5.44”.

Now I know what you’re thinking. 5.44 inches? That’s pathetic. But think of it this way: That’s his flaccid length. Now, imagine Thanos when aroused. On average, the human penis generally doubles in length when going from flaccid to hard. This means that Thano’s kielbasa is likely almost 12 inches, when fully erect. If you still think that this is small, just try and imagine that absolute unit of a cock shoved into your tight little ass. His massive purple rod being passionately thrust back and forth, ripping your rectum to shreds. And don’t even get me started on his cum. The thought of Thanos just unloading gallons and gallons of children into me just makes me rock hard. There is nothing that turns me on more than Thano’s massive 12 inch dick. I wish he would just shove it in every hole in my body. I want him to take his flaccid dick, and wrap it around my neck like a noose. That would just be pure ecstasy to me. Getting strangled to death by Thano’s bad boy would probably feel so amazing. The only thing that would make it better, would be if he wasn’t circumcised. I’d be able to peel back his foreskin, like a big, purple, meaty banana. I’d peel it back, and I’d eat every last particle of dick cheese. I’d lick it all up, until his meat flute was all shiny and sticky. And once it’s all lubed up, I’d let him put it in my butt again. He wouldn’t hold back this time. He’d fuck me so hard, that all my inside get jimmied around, and it would be amazing. Then he’d cum again, but this time there’s be so much that it fills up my entire body. Just imagine: Thanos has almost finished ravaging your butthole, when he unleashed a tsunami of hot, sticky semen into your body. It fills up your ass, but Thano’s sex pistol is so thick, that it won’t leak out through my booty. But he keeps releasing more. Eventually, it starts filling up my intestines and stomach, before it eventually begins to quickly flow out from my mouth. At this point, I’m vomiting Thanos’s cum everywhere, but I’m not doing it fast enough. The pressure builds, as the semen starts to slowly drip out of every hole im my body. My dick, my nose, my ears, and even my eyes. But it’s just not enough. Thanos’s keeps ejaculating. He’s like an infinite water source of daddy sauce. The pressure is too great! I explode in a glorious display of semen and viscera. By stomach as burst open, and I am now just a head and torso, but only the back half of my torso remains. Yet somehow, I survive. All my limbs are blown off, as well as my own dick. Thanos caresses what’s left of my face, with his thick, purple hand.

“I want to keep going.” Thanos says to me, gently, “Are you okay with that?”

Despite the fact that my windpipes are mostly exploded, I manage to say to him, “Yes.”

Thanos nods, and proceeds to kiss me passionately on the lips.

He unsheaths his excalibur, and gently inserts into the new hole, where my dick used to be. He picks me up, now that I’m little more than a lump of flesh. He slowly pulls his dick in and out of me, in an attempt to make sure that my new pussy would be an adequate hole. Upon determining that it is, he begins to violently move me up and down, as if I was nothing more than just a fleshlight. But since I was with the love of my life, Thanos- I didn’t even care. After a little while more, his sex pistol is cocked, and he fires one more last burst of cum. This shot was so intense, that I slide right out of him, and blast off into space. “Million Miles An Hour” by Nickelback begins to play, as I rocketed through the cosmos. The intense heat of Thano’s semen prevents me from freezing to death.

Back on the planet where we fucked, Thanos quietly whispers to my quickly shrinking body, “No homo…”

I traveled through the galaxy for what felt like days, before I became caught in the gravity of a black hole. Thanos’s semen was still keeping me alive, but the propulsion wasn’t strong enough to prevent me from getting sucked in. Upon reaching the black hole’s event horizon, something incredible happened. Thano’s juice ignited, and exploded. The explosion eventually resulted in the formation of a star. Upon the star’s creation, I was launched out into the star’s orbit, before my body was ripped apart by the immense gravity of the sun, and my various parts were cast to the void. But my soul remained attached to the star that had just formed. I watched for billions of years, as my pieces’ own gravitational pulls slowly began to attract other particles, until they all eventually became planets. I continued to watch over this new solar system. Eventually, on the third planet out, I saw something amazing. I watched, as from the planet’s primordial ooze, a small life form emerged. Through the ages, I watched as this life evolved, grew and took on a much more complex form. After some time, they became a species known as “human”. These human were intelligent. But not nearly intelligent enough for other beings to visit them. The Humans eventually named me. I was to be referred to as Sol. I continued to watch over these humans, as their culture developed further. Unil one day, a film known as “Avengers: Infinity War” was released. It was a cultural phenomenon, although it wasn’t very good from an objective standpoint. But the humans loved it. And one character, they love more than most. And his name- was Thanos. When Thanos appeared as a character on Earth, I knew that my journey was complete. I cannot explain how, but some way or another- some part of Thanos had stayed with the body part that eventually became Earth. And as a result, his influence could be seen all throughout history. This all came to a head, with Infinity War. Thanos’s semen gave life to an entire planet of creature, and they repaid him in the ultimate way. Thanos has now been forever immortalized in their culture. As the most competently written characters, in one of the most mediocre movies of all time.

Oh, you saw the number 69 and said nice? Nice? No, this 69 shit ain't fucking nice. Nice is taking a walk in the park and randomly finding a $100 bill. Nice is reading a good book during your leisure time. NICE is having ACTUAL SEX and ACTUALLY 69ING. This SHIT is just a number that you retards worship for free karma, retweets, (You)s, whatever the fuck niggas are calling them nowadays. Fuck your 69s and fuck your nice

I keep having dreams where I call Obama the N-word and I want it to stop (from r/confessions)
This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Some background. Politically, I've been a Democrat my entire life and an Obama supporter for as long as I can remember. I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured.

When he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could believe in.

When it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.

The problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said "Yeah, N***er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?

A week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of "The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N***er" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly "Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.

The most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely "excuse me for one moment" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.

i found this on AITA and i genuinely thought i was reading a copypasta at first
AITA for calling my brother a piss baby?

My brother (27m) lives with my parents and I (16m). My brother is a nice guy/incel. He’s constantly ranting about how girls won’t go out with him, and how apparently they’re all dirty whores for not liking him. My parents seem to only encourage his behavior. What’s worse is he’s a gym teacher, so his female students (some of whom are my classmates) are exposed to his nasty ass attitude.

Last night, my brother went on another long rant about the latest girl who managed to resist his ‘nice guy charm.’ He kept going on about it, and I got annoyed because of it. I told him, ‘Maybe if you weren’t such a piss baby someone would want to date you.’ (Piss baby was said because my parents have forbidden the term incel in our house. Because my brother gets upset over it. Also, it was the first thing I could come up with other than incel)

Surprise, my brother gets upset about it. My dad tells me to apologize to my brother, and I tell him I wasn’t going to apologize to a nasty ass piss baby who goes around treating people (mainly women) like shit just because he’s a ‘nice guy.’ Things escalate to where my dad, brother and I are all screaming at each other at the dinner table. It ends with me being told to find a friend to stay with for the night, because my parents (and brother) are sooo disappointed in me. I got a long voice mail telling me how disappointing I was. I got told I went too far, and should regret my actions. I don’t regret my actions, and I don’t think I went too far, but whatever.

AITA for "bullying" a co-worker?
On mobile, English ain't native language, yada yada.

So I walk up to this bitch (apparently right after she got divorced) and say "what's up Karen you wanna go for a jog this afternoon haha" and she's like "please just leave me alone" and I'm like "whatever bitch" and then like an hour later get called into our HR person's office and they're like "you gotta stop harassing Karen she's going through a lot right now, she's just signed her divorce papers"

And I'm like "hah who'd married that skank, someone with a wheelchair fetish?" And my HR person (Hank) was well like "come on man, they've been married for 16 years. They've been having trouble since her accident last year. She thinks he blames her for getting into the accident that killed their kids" and I'm all like lol

So I leave and I'm hungry so I go to grab my lunch (turkey and provolone) only to see, lo and behold, that dumb bitch Karen set her bag of lunch RIGHT in front of mine!! so I write out a note saying how glad I am to be working with her but if she puts her lunch in front of mine again I swear to fuck I will finish the job that God couldn't

So I go through the rest of my day joking around with Karen every time I see her even though she is I giant cunt about it (my favorite was 'accidently' dropping a pair of scissors on her colostomy bag lol) and I have to ignore the picture of that fucking rat whenever I walk by her desk

So I finish my day asking for her ex husband's number since I need a new wingman to look for some babes with and she fucking flips it and when she's yelling at me I'm all like "maybe if you don't want to get divorced you shouldn't have gotten hit by a drink driver you ever think of that bitch" and then she rolled away aggressively

So AITA?

From a shitty discord server after someone lost an argument
I am being serious: none of you are intelligent enough to understand why you're stupid. Usually I'm memeing or injecting a little bit of irony for fun but there is no irony here. All of you, with one or two exceptions, have little more than a thimbleful of political credibility and it stems from your complete inability to think through or research your points beyond coming to a conclusion spoon-fed to you by the culture around you since birth. None of you have the intellectual capacity to question the world around you and at least half of you don't even have the potential to develop it.

From a review on the steam game "Hentai Nazi"
My 97 year old grandfather fought in ww2 and he always used to tell me stories about the ww2. he was just 18 when he faced battle for the first time. So i wanted to show him this game to make him happy about the (good?) old days. My grandfather never been a huge fan of electronic devices. But I managed to get him to play this game on my laptop. I explained everything but he didn't understand it at first but later he learned how to walk in this game. His first impression was... Quiet. And he still was figuring everything out. But after 2 minutes he stood up. And went outside for a walk. When he came back it was time for dinner. then he bursts out crying. "I fought for this?'' he said. Then he kept on crying. my parents tried to cheer him up. but he kept crying. So we all silently finished eating our food. went home. I felt akward. Sad and ashamed. then I busted a big nut rubbin' it out on this game. 10/10 would bust again

Being a hentai actress must be weird.
Being a hentai actress must be so weird. Imagine this: you’re in a soundproof room pleasurably screaming into an 800,000¥ microphone about how much you love old man dick at 10:47 AM on a Tuesday in October while your 45-year-old boss oversees you through a glass window from the other room. You eventually look up after 2 hours of practicing your unnaturally high-pitched moans and see him give you a big thumbs up as you pretend to have an orgasm.
